Somewhere between 2015 and 2016 my mom bought an small laptop for her work. It only worked for so 4 months when it just stopped powering on. We took it to  an repair shop, they said the mother board fried and it will cost almost the price of an new laptop to fix it. So we just put it in closet. Few years later we bought two new laptops. One day we were cleaning the closet and found the old laptop (It still smelled new). I thought: Maybe I can fix this or just see whats inside. So I took it and removed the screws and the cover. I found out that the repair shop never opened it up (They probably just guess about the mother board). I saw nothing wrong with the mother board or anything else. So I just Googled it and found an thread on Tom's guide (see resources). They said to remove the battery and power it on with just plugged in to the main. It powered on!! Now the problem is I don't know what the password is. Some tries later and we are in. I found games on it that isent downloadeble anymore and some that costs money now.
