Somewhere between 2015 and 2016 my mom bought an small laptop for her work. It only worked for so 4 months when it just stopped powering on. We took it to  an repair shop, they said the mother board fried and it will cost almost the price of an new laptop to fix it. So we just put it in closet. Few years later we bought two new laptops. One day we were cleaning the closet and found the old laptop (It still smelled new). I thought: Maybe I can fix this or just see whats inside. So I took it and removed the screws and the cover. I found out that the repair shop never opened it up (They probably just guess about the mother board). I saw nothing wrong with the mother board or anything else. So I just Googled it and found an thread on Tom's guide (see resources). They said to remove the battery and power it on with just plugged in to the main. It powered on!! Now the problem is I don't know what the password is. Some tries later and we are in. I found games on it that isent downloadeble anymore and some that costs money now. And 10X more storage then my old laptop. It took me 2 days to uninstall all the junk apps my mom installed for her work and optimize it. I might sell my old laptop or I can use it as an server. If this laptop didnt brake my mom wouldn't have spend R10K on two new laptops. This laptop does max its hardware when you play games; it is not like the game takes more then 50% of the cpu or ram. Its windows that takes so much. Maybe I should switch to Linux? It hates browser things but when I optimized it i can run discord, broswer and visual studio code (made in electron). I might replace the cpu with an newer one. This laptops original had windows 8 but whe updated it when windows 10 came out. It being slower on some things can also be due to it having an solid hardrive and not an ssid. I loved this project becuase I could see whats inside an laptop and now I will never run out of starage.
